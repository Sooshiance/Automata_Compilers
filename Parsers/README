## LL1

A top-down parser that uses a one-token lookahead is called an LL(1) parser. The first L indicates that the input is read from left to right. The second L says that it produces a left-to-right derivation. And the 1 says that it uses one lookahead token.

For the sake of time we assume these our candidate grammar:

1. E → T E'
2. E' → + T E' | ε
3. T → F T'
4. T' → * F T' | ε
5. F → ( E ) | id

As you can see, it's a simple grammar for prioritization in mathematics.
